4Runners listed today.

Check the PostgreSQL database and see if any of these vehicles have already been stored. If they have been, ignore them.
The `psql` command is available. The database connection string is in the environment variable PGURL. The table is
called "vehicles". If the table doesn't exist yet, create it. The only thing that needs to be stored in the table
is the URL for each vehicle. Don't add any other fields.

For each vehicle that was not already in the database, store the information about it into the database, and send
an email with information about those vehicles. If there are no new vehicles, then don't send an email.
