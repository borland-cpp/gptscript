For each of the examples .gpt files in the examples directory,
please read them and determine logical test cases. Be sure to include
input and expected output for each test case. Think about potential
edge cases and how the program should handle them. Update their associated
.test.txt files in the integration/tests directory with the tests cases
you have determined.

Do not remove the existing test cases and ensure they follow the same
format as the existing tests.
