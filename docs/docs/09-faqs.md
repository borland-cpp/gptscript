#### I don't have Homebrew, how can I install GPTScript?
On MacOS and Linux, you can alternatively install via: `curl https://get.gptscript.ai/install.sh | sh`

On all supported systems, you download and install the archive for your platform and architecture from the [releases page](https://github.com/gptscript-ai/gptscript/releases).


#### Does GPTScript have an SDK or API I can program against?

Currently, there are three SDKs being maintained: [Python](https://github.com/gptscript-ai/py-gptscript), [Node](https://github.com/gptscript-ai/node-gptscript), and [Go](https://github.com/gptscript-ai/go-gptscript). They are currently under development and are being iterated on relatively rapidly. The READMEs in each repository contain the most up-to-date documentation for the functionality of each.
